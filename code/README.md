# Milestones and Work Division
The objectives of this milestone are listed below and the work division is _group wise_ and the group information can be found in the repository's `README.md`. Objectives of evaluation meetings will be to analyze the work progress, evaluate the work done uptil then, elucidate the problems and challenges faced and how they were solved and finally discussion about the next milestone.

## Milestone - 1
- __Getting Started__: Introduction to ML, Git, Python, Object Oriented Analysis and Design
- __Let's Research__: Dive deeper into existing works and create a flow of their work with your additions
- __Design__: Class and Sequence diagrams based on the work flow
- __Corpus__: Data collection and cleaning up of data

### Work Division for Milestone - 1
- __Group - I__: Research + research work flow, Class diagrams
- __Group - II__: Research + research work flow, Sequence diagrams
- __Group - III__: Research + research work flow, Data collection, Data cleaning (_features_)

#### Evaluation - I for Milestone - 1
End of October, 2018

## Milestone - 2
- __Featuring the Features__: Creation of _feature sets_ [1], analysis of proof of concept and improvisations (if any)
- __Let's ML__: ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, etc.)
- __Let's Research Again__: Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Selection 

### Work Division for Milestone - 2
- __Group - I__: Feature set 1 + improvisations, 3 ML algorithms, 2 dimensionality reduction techniques
- __Group - II__: Feature set 2 + improvisations, 3 ML algorithms, 2 dimensionality reduction techniques
- __Group - III__: Feature set 3 + improvisations, 2 ML algorithms, 1 dimensionality reduction techniques

#### Evaluation - II for Milestone - 2
Start of January, 2019

<hr/>

## Milestone - 3
- __Modeling__: Applying models and dimensionality reduction techniques to features and predicting!
- __Improvising__: Using ensemble methods to improve classification accuracy
- __Validating__: Evaluation of model metrics, design consistency, reusability of code, future improvisations

### Work Division for Milestone - 3
- __Group - I__: Modeling, Improvising, Validating
- __Group - II__: Modeling, Improvising, Validating
- __Group - III__: Modeling, Improvising, Validating


#### Evaluation - III for Milestone - 3
Start of February, 2019
