# Twitter Suicidal Analysis


Mining __social media__ has been the existing area of interest of many researchers mainly to obtain 
insights about _human psychological traits_. While social media can be mined for a variety of applications that include
advertisement interests, promotion statistics; we aim at mining to predict suicidal instincts. 


## Overview
Online social networks, have increased connectivity between people. Mining such information can provide many benefits to 
society, such as providing reassurance and emergency management in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters. Here we mine
social media for predicting suicidal tweets, which might mitigate the effects of the same when timely action is taken.

&nbsp;  By the end of the project we aim at reporting the results of a number of machine classifiers built with the aim of 
classifying text relating to suicide on Twitter. The classifier distinguishes between the more worrying content, 
such as suicidal ideation, and other suicide-related topics such as reporting of a suicide, memorial, campaigning and support.
Also, we aim at improving the results obtained from baseline classifiers by ensemble techniques. We also aim at validating our
results using known metrics.
